History
-------
The "O" language is not really new, but the part of a long story and continuous evolution. "O" is a direct successor of K5 (2016/7, http://kparc.com). But only ideologically, it doesn’t share a single line of code with K5 and implemented in Rust instead of C. O started in Dec 2016 (Maxim Sokhatsky et al), have been redesigned 5 times so far, current design is polished enough.

What’s "a vector language"?

- Vectors (arrays) are first class type
- Most functions are defined on both vectors and scalars
- "No Stinking Loops"
- Basic syntax derived from M-expressions
